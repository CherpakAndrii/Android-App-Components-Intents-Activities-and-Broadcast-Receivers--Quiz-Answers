# Module 1
## Android App Components - Intents Activities and Broadcast Receivers

### Question 1: Which of the following are examples of hardware elements commonly found in Android devices (choose all that apply):

* Intent
* ***Wifi***
* ***Random access memory***
* Activity
* ***Central processing unit***
* Broadcast Receiver
* ***Accelerometer***
* ***Graphics processing unit***

### Question 2: Which of the following describe the purposes of the Android Linux kernel (choose all that apply):
* ***Optimizes GNU Linux to meet the needs of mobile devices and apps***
* A set of Java-based services that form the environment in which Android apps run and are managed
* Provides reusable capabilities that extend hardware-centric OS kernel and protocol mechanisms
* ***Shields higher layers of Android from hardware diversity***
* ***Mediates access to--and sharing of--hardware resources***
* Shields OEMs from GNU Public License "virality"

### Question 3: Which of the following are examples of layers and/or elements found in Android's middleware infrastructure (choose all that apply):
* Power Management
* Activity Manager Service
* Binder (IPC) Driver
* ***Native C/C++ libraries***
* ***Hardware abstraction layer***
* ***Android Run-Time (ART)***

### Question 4: Which of the following are examples of Android app components (choose all that apply):
* ***Broadcast Receivers***
* Package Manager
* ***Activities***
* Dalvik Virtual Machine
* ***Content Providers***
* ***Services***

### Question 5: Which of the following are true statements about Java threads (choose all that apply)
* Starting a thread takes a trivial amount of time and system resources
* ***Every thread contains a call stack to keep track of method state***
* ***Each process can have multiple threads***
* ***A thread is the smallest unit of execution for sequences of programmed instructions***
* ***A Java thread must be given code to run when it is started***
* Starting a Java thread is the only way to write a concurrent Android app

### Question 6: Which of the following are true statements about application frameworks in the context of Android (choose all that apply):
* ***Android frameworks provide an integrated set of components that provide a reusable architecture for a family of related mobile apps***
* ***Android frameworks enhance systematic reuse by providing canonical structure and functionality to mobile apps***
* ***Android frameworks use an event-driven programming model to plug app code into them***
* Android frameworks enable app component to dictate the flow of control in a program, rather than the frameworks themselves

### Question 7: Which of the following are true statements about the Android Application Framework layer (choose all that apply):
* It shields OEMs from GNU Public License "virality"
* ***It contains system services that provide apps with the capabilities and info they need to do their work***
* ***Its system services run continuously during system operation***
* It optimizes GNU Linux to meet the needs of mobile devices and apps

### Question 8: Which of the following are true statements about the Android apps (choose all that apply):
* The bulk of these apps are written in C/C++
* These apps cannot be written in C/C++
* ***The bulk of these apps are written in Java***
* ***It's possible to write portions of the apps in C/C++***
